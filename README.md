# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **feature understanding** of the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The goal is to analyze passenger characteristics and identify key factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

This project demonstrates my skills in:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Statistical insights using Python

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset is taken from the **Kaggle Titanic Dataset** and contains information about passengers such as:

- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
- Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
- Fare
- Embarkation Port
- Survival Status

### Files Used:
- `Titanic_train.csv`
- `Titanic_test.csv`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
The following analysis was carried out in the notebooks:

- Data inspection and understanding
- Handling missing values
- Univariate analysis
- Bivariate analysis (Survival vs other features)
- Gender-based survival analysis
- Class-based survival comparison
- Age and fare distribution analysis
- Visualizations using plots and charts

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a **higher survival rate** than males.
- Passengers in **1st class** were more likely to survive.
- Children had better survival chances.
- Higher fare-paying passengers had higher survival probability.
